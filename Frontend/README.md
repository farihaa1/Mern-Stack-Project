# Food Dash

FoodDash AI is a comprehensive full-stack food delivery application, inspired by DoorDash, enhanced with AI-powered voice interaction. It allows users to search for food, place orders, interact via voice commands, and track deliveries in real-time. It includes separate interfaces for customers, restaurants, and delivery personnel.


This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
